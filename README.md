RobotFramework example with SwingLibrary

I have created a simple Swing Application called DemoSwing
Do the following steps first:
- Mvn clean install

when you have built it (the test is run automatically)
but if you want to run it individually just run
- mvn robotframework:run

target folder generates the report.html
